                There are several user permission levels:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Standard:</strong> The level attributed to the majority of users.
                        These users are able to read and change data in "Myself" (except affiliation data).
                        They have no access to any other features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Team:</strong> For users managing their team data (members and publications).
                        These users are able to pre-register new members.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Local Managers:</strong> Users that manage data from all teams within a location (e.g. Lisboa, Porto).
                        They are able to read data from all users but can only change data from users with the same location as them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Global Managers:</strong> Users that manage data from all teams anywhere.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Information is organized into cards that group related data:<br>
                <img class="help small" ng-src="/images/help/general/general_1.png">
            </li>
            <li>In general, whenever you make changes within a card you should press the "Update" button:
                <md-button type="submit" class="button-small md-raised md-primary">Update</md-button>
            </li>
            <li>
                Items tagged with an asterisk are required. An end date can be empty if there is no foreseeable end date
                for that entity.
            </li>
            <li>A <md-icon md-svg-src="images/icons/add_24px.svg"></md-icon> sign means that you can add another instance of the same type of data,
                whereas a <md-icon md-svg-src="images/icons/remove_24px.svg"></md-icon> sign means that you want to remove that particular instance.
            </li>
            <li>Selection boxes with many items usually have a search feature at the top of the selection list.
                This example is taken from the selection of countries:<br>
                <img class="help smaller" ng-src="/images/help/general/general_2.png">
            </li>
        </ul>
