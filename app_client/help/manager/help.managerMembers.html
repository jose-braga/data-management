                A manager is greeted with three lists:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>With roles:</strong> People who have a known affiliation to a team (whether scientific, technical, science management or administrative).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Without roles:</strong> People whose affiliation is not known. With time this list should tend to a size of zero elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To validate:</strong> New members with pending pre-registrations validation. Check regularly this list.
                        Only members with validated pre-registrations will appear on lists of people.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The list of people with roles can be exported to a spreadsheet file by pressing on the spreadsheet icon on the top of the page.
            </li>
            <li>
                To check change the details of a particular person press the <md-icon md-svg-src="images/icons/description_24px.svg"></md-icon> icon.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the details tab for each person (appearing to the right of "Without roles") the view and functionalities are similar
                to what is described in the "Myself" section.
            </li>
            <li>
                The manager can choose a new password for a user in case the user forgets his/her password.
            </li>
        </ul>
